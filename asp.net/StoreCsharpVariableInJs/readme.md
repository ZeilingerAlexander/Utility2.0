# Store C# Variables in Javascript
## Store C# variables locally in the users browser using js
### This Example uses a Dictionary but can be applied to different use cases

## How-To :
### 1) Load values into the Viewbag on-get or bind them over the model
### 2) Retrieve the Values in the cshtml page and load them into hidden fields
#### When loading multiple Values they can be split with a splitter, be careful when using this on user-inputs since they can contain splitters
### 3) In Javascript load the values into a variable by retrieving them from the hidden field
